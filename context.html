# Topics

## What are we speaking about ?
My research is at the crossroads of both parallel programming, software design and a wee bit of
compilation. Without replaying the old song of the End of the Moore's Law, we're now dealing with
relatively complex computer hardware that promise to deliver billions and billions of operations per
second. However, accessing this computing power is complicated for software developers.

But, in fact, the real issue is that reaping the benefits from those Über-Machines is even more
complicated for scientists with few to no computer science background. This is actually a shame
as computing is now a fundamental pillar of science, replacing experimentations in a lot of context.

Fast computation is a form of time travel -- minus the cool car and the GWatts -- as a faster
simulation means a faster access to new scientific results which means faster publication, more
grants and so on.

My work tries to bridge the gap between Über-Machines requiring 10xDevelopers to be mastered and
the requirement of scientist, for which computing is a mean not an end.

## So, what do we do then ?
I'm trying to solve those issues on multiple fronts:

  - **Computer Architecture Exploration** in which I try to get my hands on new CPUs, accelerators
    or what have you and try to see what's the best way to design computing software for them.

  - **Computing Library Design** by using and abusing `C++` to be able to build efficient yet
    expressive libraries for computing science.

  - **Compilation and Meta-Programming** where we try to find new way to generate efficient program
    by using new flavor of code generation. Our main activity is centered around the design, evaluation
    and deployment of **Embedded Domain Specific Languages**, i.e language within language.

## C++, you can't be serious
I am. C++ has the advantages of being efficient by design, play well with the notion of meta-programming
and has a good run at providing tools for building EDSL. C++ is also a language you can push towards
the Industry and so, it facilitates the adoption of those techniques.

A side effect of this research is that we can try to see what nuggets of language can be passed up
to the ISO C++ Standardization Committee in which I have a feet.

## Cool, I want to know more
