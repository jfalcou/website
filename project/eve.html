# EVE

EVE is a re-implementation of the old EVE SIMD library by Falcou et al. which for a while
was named Boost.SIMD. It's a C++20 and onward implementation of a type based wrapper around
SIMD extensions sets for most current architectures. It aims at showing how C++20 can be used
to design and implement efficient, low level, high abstraction library suited for high performances.

It's a research project first and an open source library second. We reserve the right to change API
and baseline compiler required until the first official 0.1 release. However, we'll try to minimize
disruption. Semantic versioning will ensure API retro-compatibility if anything huge needs to change.

EVE is considered in advanced beta: it's usable, has an almost complete feature sets for a sensible
amount of instructions sets but it's possible some values or performances issues may still remain.
Don't hesitate to report any funky code-gen or bad optimizations so we can deliver the best performance around.
