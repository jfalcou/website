# NT2

## Goal and History

The Numerical Template Toolbox (NT2) is an Open Source C++ library aimed at simplifying the
development, debugging and optimization of high-performance computing applications by providing
a Matlab like syntax that eases the transition between prototype and actual application.

NT2 development has been the work of multiple of my Ph. D students:

  - Pierre Estérie, who kickstarted the new version based on architecture/language split
  - Antoine Tran Tan, who worked on the multi-core variant and HPX integration
  - Ian Masliah, who dealt with GPGPU support.

We ended up with something usable but:
  - some performance issues subsisted and required massive rework
  - adding architecture was becoming complex

The project is now currently halted, **but a new version is currently being prepared** as a less
monolithic software library.

## Download

An archive version, up-to-date till the GPGPU Magma wrappings, is [**available here**](https://github.com/jtlap/nt2).
It probably needs some polishing to be able to compile with recent compiler.
