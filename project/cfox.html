# C+FOX

C+FOX is an Open Source C++ library that provides an easy to use interface for acquiring images
from FireWire camera on OS X platform. It is based on the JAVA Firewire Camera Acquisition
library FWCamAkiz by Adrian Daerr.

FireWire is one of the fastest peripheral standards ever developed, which makes it great for use
with multimedia peripherals such as digital video cameras and other high-speed devices like the
latest hard disk drives and printers. However, using it efficiently under MAC OS X system requires
a deep understanding of how FireWire interacts with the lowest layers of this OS. This leads to code
that can't be easily kept clean or debugged. This is even more true for digital camera.

Far from Quicktime or hand-written C IOKit interface, C+FOX provides an interface so that
reading from a FireWire camera becomes as easy as getting data from the standard input.

C+FOX has been tested on PowerPC G4, G5 and on XServe G5.

!!! WARNING
    This C++ library was designed for early MacOSX version, back in the day Apple still used
    PowerPC CPUs. The technical stack probably changed since then but I archive this project
    just in case some time-traveling alien from year 5000 needs to run a FW camera on a 2005
    Macintosh to save the galaxy.

    We never know.
