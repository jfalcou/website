# Short Intro

I am Joel Falcou, Destroyer of World, Terror of the Compilers.

![ ](media/me.jpg width="256" ) In my spare time, I am an associated professor at the University Paris-Saclay and researcher at the
[Laboratoire de Recherche dâ€™Informatique](https://www.lri.fr/) in Orsay, France. My research focuses
on studying generative programming idioms and techniques to design tools for parallel software
development.

I also have a rather personal take on humor as you may have noticed already.

The main parts of my work are:
  - the exploration of Embedded Domain Specific Language design for parallel computing on various
    architectures;
  - the definition of a formal framework for reasoning about meta-programs.

As I need something to pad my academic paper up to at least eight pages, I usually play around with
various application fields like real-time image processing on embedded architectures or HPC on
multi-core clusters.

I am the co-host of the [**C++FRUG Meetup**](https://www.meetup.com/fr-FR/User-Group-Cpp-Francophone/),
president of the C++FRUG Association and I co-organize the [**CPPP Conference**](https://cppp.fr/).

I am also part entrepreneur. I founded NUMSCALE in 2012 and I am also the founder and training
advisor of [**CODE RECKONS**](https://www.codereckons.com).

When not trying to not cross the `std::iostream`, you can find me at a Magic: The Gathering EDH game
or watching B series horror flicks.
